            and a black coat walks along a quiet residential street during daytime, 
            holding a small bottle in his hand. He looks back toward the camera with
             a neutral expression. The street is lined with a mix of old and modern 
             buildings, some with brick facades and others with traditional suburban
              architecture. Leafless trees stand tall, their branches reaching out 
              against the overcast sky. A few people walk in the distance, and parked
               cars line the road. The scene has a calm, introspective atmosphere, 
               enhanced by the black-and-white color scheme.">
